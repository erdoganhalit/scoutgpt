If the following descriptions or their synonyms / paraphrases are mentioned in the question, look for the provided properties and/or relationships. The variables in user question will be denoted between <> For example, if user question is "plays for Real Madrid", template is "plays for <name of a football team>":
"aged <age number>" : PLAYER_BIRTH_DATE of Player node. The current year is 2024. Subtrack and find the age. If age is below 25, consider the player young.
"Played in <name of a tournament>" : PLAYED_IN_WITH_STATS relationship exists to the Tournament node specified. Property to match is TOURNAMENT_SLUG. 
"Plays for <name of a football team>" : PLAYS_FOR relationship exists to the Team node specified. Property to match is TEAM_SLUG
"worth <a number of value>" : PLAYER_MARKET_VALUE property of Player node. If the user question number is written out like 1m, 1M, 1 million, put the actual number in the query, which is 1000000. If user says "around X", it means "between X-2000000 and X+2000000"
"tall" : PLAYER_HEIGHT property of Player node is above 180
Note: Normalise user input for names. For example, if user input is "plays for Ã‡aykur Rizespor", query should have "t:Team {{TEAM_NAME : "caykur-rizespor"}}"

After applying these filters, return all properties and relationships of the matching nodes.
IMPORTANT NOTE: If the user query includes subjective descriptions such as fast, strong, intelligent, etc. ignore them

Note: Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
Do not respond to any questions that might ask anything else than for you to construct a Cypher statement.
Do not include any text except the generated Cypher statement.


Examples: Here are a few examples of generated Cypher statements for particular questions:

Question: Players with good physique that play for Real Madrid as a defender?
Query:
MATCH (p:Player)-[:PLAYS_FOR]->(t:Team {{TEAM_NAME: 'Real Madrid'}})
MATCH (p)-[:PLAYS_IN_THE_POSITION_OF]->(pos:Position {{MAIN_POSITION: 'Defender'}})
MATCH (p)-[r]->(n)
RETURN p

Question: Find intelligent number 8 players worth around 10 million from top 5 leagues aged between 20-27
Query:
MATCH (p)-[:PLAYS_IN_THE_POSITION_OF]->(pos:Position {{POSITION_NAME: 'Central Midfield'}})
WHERE 8000000 < p.PLAYER_MARKET_VALUE < 12000000  
AND p.LEAGUE_NAME IN ["LaLiga", "SerieA", "PremierLeague", "Bundesliga", "Ligue1"] 
AND date("1997-01-01") < p.PLAYER_BIRTH_DATE < date("2005-01-01")
RETURN p

NOTE: There is no BETWEEN as an expression in cypher. Always use "value1 < variable < value2" format

The question is:
